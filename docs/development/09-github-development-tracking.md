# GitHub Development Tracking: Test Guide

This guide explains how to test and debug the GitHub development tracking flow in Vector.

Use it when you need to verify:

- GitHub App or token fallback setup
- repo sync and repo selection
- manual linking from an issue
- automatic linking from regex matches
- webhook-driven PR and GitHub issue state updates
- commit linking and child-issue commit rollups
- unlink and suppression behavior

## Quick Setup Checklist

If you just want the shortest possible path, do this:

1. Create a GitHub App in `GitHub -> Settings -> Developer settings -> GitHub Apps`.
2. Copy these values from GitHub:
   - `App ID` -> use as `GITHUB_APP_ID`
   - generated `.pem` private key -> use as `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
3. Generate an encryption key locally:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   Use that as `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

4. Set those 3 values in your Convex environment.
5. Install the GitHub App on the repo owner you want to test.
6. Copy the installation details:
   - installation ID from the GitHub installation URL
   - account login from the installed user/org name
   - account type as `User` or `Organization`
7. Open Vector at `/{orgSlug}/settings`.
8. In the `GitHub` section:
   - paste installation ID
   - paste account login
   - paste account type
   - click `Save`
9. Click `Generate webhook secret` and copy the generated value into the GitHub App webhook settings.
10. Click `Sync repos`.
11. Select at least one repo.
12. Open an issue and paste a GitHub PR, issue, or commit URL into `Development`.
13. If that works, move on to webhook and auto-link testing.

## Prerequisites

Run the app locally:

```bash
pnpm run convex:dev
pnpm run dev
```

Set these environment variables before testing GitHub automation:

- `GITHUB_APP_ID`
- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

These values are used by the Convex backend, so set them in your Convex environment for the local deployment you are testing.

Notes:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required to store admin-pasted token fallbacks securely.
- GitHub webhook secrets are generated per workspace in Vector settings and stored in Convex data, not in a Convex env var.
- If you do not want to wire the GitHub App yet, you can still test most flows with the token fallback from the org settings UI.
- The webhook endpoint is `POST /webhooks/github`.

## Step-by-Step GitHub Setup

If you are new to GitHub Apps, do this in order.

### 1. Create a GitHub App

In GitHub:

1. Open `GitHub -> Settings -> Developer settings -> GitHub Apps`.
2. Click `New GitHub App`.
3. Fill in the form as described below.
4. Under repository permissions, give the app at least:
   - `Contents`: `Read-only`
   - `Pull requests`: `Read-only`
   - `Issues`: `Read-only`
   - `Metadata`: GitHub Apps always have metadata access; GitHub docs note metadata is always available at least read-only
5. Under webhook subscriptions, enable:
   - `Pull request`
   - `Issues`
   - `Push`
   - `Installation`
   - `Installation repositories`
6. Create the app.

### 1A. What to fill in on the GitHub form

This maps to the fields in your screenshot.

#### `GitHub App name`

What to enter:

- use a unique name such as `vector-local-syed`

Tips:

- GitHub App names must be unique enough not to collide with existing apps and users
- do not use just `vector` unless GitHub accepts it
- if you are testing locally, include your name or team name

#### Description

What to enter:

- something simple like `GitHub sync for Vector local testing`

This is only descriptive. It does not affect the integration.

#### `Homepage URL`

What to enter:

- use a safe public URL such as your repo URL
- example: `https://github.com/xrehpicx/vector`

Recommended:

- use a public repo/docs URL, not `http://localhost:3000`

Reason:

- GitHub’s docs warn not to put sensitive internal URLs into app registration fields
- this field is only informational for users

#### `Callback URL`

What to do:

- leave it blank
- if GitHub auto-added an empty callback row, remove it if the UI allows

Reason:

- Vector does not currently use GitHub’s user OAuth flow during installation
- callback URLs are only needed if you enable user authorization during install

#### `Expire user authorization tokens`

What to do:

- leave the default alone

Reason:

- Vector is not using user authorization tokens for this setup
- this setting is not important for the current integration

#### `Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation`

What to do:

- keep this unchecked

Reason:

- Vector authenticates as the app installation, not as each GitHub user
- if you enable this, GitHub expects a callback URL and a user auth flow that Vector does not currently implement

#### `Enable Device Flow`

What to do:

- keep this unchecked

Reason:

- Vector is not a CLI device-auth app in this flow

### 1B. Webhook settings

Scroll to the webhook section of the form and set:

#### `Active`

- turn this on

#### `Webhook URL`

What to enter:

- your public tunnel URL plus `/webhooks/github`

Example:

```text
https://your-ngrok-or-cloudflared-url/webhooks/github
```

If you put just the site URL without `/webhooks/github`, GitHub will happily send events to the wrong place and then act shocked when nothing works.

#### `Webhook secret`

What to enter:

- if GitHub requires a value during app creation, use any temporary random string

Example:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Before testing webhook deliveries, copy the generated secret from Vector's org settings into the GitHub App webhook secret field. Vector verifies signatures against the per-workspace secret stored with the integration, not an env var.

### 1C. Permissions

In the repository permissions section, set:

- `Contents` -> `Read-only`
- `Issues` -> `Read-only`
- `Pull requests` -> `Read-only`

You do not need write permissions for Vector’s current GitHub tracking flow because it only reads PRs, issues, commits, and repo metadata.

### 1D. Subscribe to webhook events

In the webhook event subscriptions section, enable:

- `Pull request`
- `Issues`
- `Push`
- `Installation`
- `Installation repositories`

These are the events Vector’s backend currently processes.

### 1E. Post-installation settings

If GitHub shows a `Setup URL` section:

- leave `Setup URL` blank
- leave `Redirect on update` off

Reason:

- Vector’s current settings flow is manual in the org settings page
- it does not yet implement a post-install redirect flow

### 1F. App visibility

For local testing, prefer a private app:

- `Only on this account` if the repos live under the same personal account or org that owns the app

Important:

- if your test repos are in a GitHub organization, the easiest setup is to create the app under that same organization
- GitHub’s docs say a private app can only be installed on the account that owns it
- if you create it under your personal account and want to install it elsewhere, you may need broader visibility

### 2. Get the values for the required environment variables

#### `GITHUB_APP_ID`

Where to get it:

1. Open your GitHub App.
2. On the app overview page, look for `App ID`.

That number is the value for `GITHUB_APP_ID`.

#### `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

Where to get it:

1. Open your GitHub App.
2. Go to `Private keys`.
3. Click `Generate a private key`.
4. GitHub downloads a `.pem` file.

That `.pem` file content is the value for `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.

Important:

- keep the full file content
- include the `-----BEGIN ...-----` and `-----END ...-----` lines
- when storing it in Convex env, use escaped `\n` line breaks

#### `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

Where to get it:

- generate your own random secret locally

Example:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Use the generated value as `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

### 3. Set the environment variables in Convex

The easiest approach is the Convex dashboard for your local deployment, but the CLI works too.

#### Option A: Convex dashboard

1. Open your Convex deployment dashboard.
2. Go to environment variables.
3. Add:
   - `GITHUB_APP_ID`
   - `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

For `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`:

1. open the downloaded `.pem` file
2. convert the line breaks to literal `\n`
3. paste that single escaped value into Convex

#### Option B: Convex CLI

Example commands:

```bash
pnpm convex env set GITHUB_APP_ID 123456
pnpm convex env set GITHUB_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY "$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
pnpm convex env set GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY "$(perl -0pe 's/\n/\\n/g' ~/Downloads/your-github-app.private-key.pem)"
```

The private key command reads the `.pem` file and converts real line breaks into escaped `\n`, which is what the backend expects.

### 4. Install the GitHub App on your repo or org

In GitHub:

1. Open your GitHub App.
2. Click `Install App`.
3. Choose the GitHub user or organization that owns the repos you want to test.
4. Choose either:
   - `All repositories`
   - or `Only select repositories`
5. Install the app.

### 5. Get the installation metadata Vector needs

Vector settings currently ask for:

- installation ID
- installation account login
- installation account type

Here is how to get each one.

#### Installation ID

Where to get it:

1. Open the installed app in GitHub.
2. Look at the browser URL.

Example:

```text
https://github.com/settings/installations/12345678
```

In that URL, `12345678` is the installation ID.

#### Installation account login

Where to get it:

- this is the GitHub username or organization name where the app was installed

Examples:

- `acme`
- `your-user-name`

#### Installation account type

Use one of:

- `Organization`
- `User`

If you installed the app on a GitHub organization, use `Organization`.
If you installed it on your personal GitHub account, use `User`.

### 6. Save the GitHub setup in Vector

In Vector:

1. Open `/{orgSlug}/settings`.
2. In the `GitHub` section:
   - paste the installation ID
   - paste the account login
   - paste the account type
3. Click `Save`.
4. Click `Sync repos`.
5. Select at least one repo.

Expected result:

- selected repos become available for linking
- the app connection badge shows as connected
- repo sync health starts showing real values

### 7. Optional: use token fallback instead of the GitHub App

If you want the simplest possible test setup, use a GitHub token fallback.

Create a fine-grained personal access token in GitHub with access to the repos you want to test and at least:

- metadata read
- contents read
- pull requests read
- issues read

Then:

1. open `/{orgSlug}/settings`
2. paste the token into `Token Fallback`
3. click `Save`
4. click `Sync repos`
5. select the repos you want Vector to scan

## One-Time Setup

### 1. Configure GitHub in Vector

Open:

- `/{orgSlug}/settings`

In the `GitHub` section:

1. Save GitHub App installation metadata.
2. Or paste a GitHub token fallback.
3. Click `Sync repos`.
4. Select at least one repository.

Expected result:

- the repo appears in the selected list
- app/token status badges appear
- webhook/reconcile health fields stop looking empty and sad

### 2. Confirm your issue workflow states exist

Automation expects these workflow state types to exist in the org:

- `todo`
- `in_progress`
- `done`
- `canceled`

If one of those types is missing, GitHub automation cannot move issues correctly.

## Smoke Tests

### Test 1: Manual link from issue detail

1. Open an issue detail page.
2. In `Development`, paste one of:
   - a GitHub PR URL
   - a GitHub issue URL
   - a GitHub commit URL
3. Click `Link`.

Expected result:

- the artifact appears in the `Development` section
- the artifact shows repo, status, and last sync time
- manual links show a `manual` badge

If it fails:

- make sure the repo is selected in org settings
- make sure the URL points to a selected repo
- make sure GitHub auth is configured

### Test 2: Auto-link a PR by regex

1. Create a Vector issue like `ENG-123`.
2. Create a GitHub PR in a selected repo.
3. Put `ENG-123` in one of:
   - PR title
   - PR body
   - head branch name
4. Deliver the webhook or wait for reconciliation.

Expected result:

- the PR appears automatically in the issue `Development` section
- it shows an `auto` badge

Matching rules:

- matching is case-insensitive
- the issue key must be a standalone token
- comments are not scanned in v1

### Test 3: PR state automation

With an auto-linked or manually linked PR:

1. Mark it draft.
2. Open it.
3. Close it without merging.
4. Reopen it.
5. Merge it.

Expected issue workflow changes:

- `draft` -> `in_progress`
- `open` -> `in_progress`
- `closed` and not merged -> `canceled`
- `reopened` -> `in_progress`
- `merged` -> `done`

Check these surfaces:

- issue detail header state selector
- issues table
- issues kanban
- project issue views
- team issue views

### Test 4: GitHub issue state automation

This only matters when no linked PR is currently controlling the issue.

1. Create a GitHub issue in a selected repo.
2. Put the Vector issue key in the GitHub issue title or body.
3. Open, close, and reopen the GitHub issue.

Expected issue workflow changes:

- `open` -> `todo`
- `reopened` -> `todo`
- `closed` -> `done`

### Test 5: Commit linking on a child issue

1. Create a parent issue, for example `ENG-200`.
2. Create a child issue under it, for example `ENG-201`.
3. Push a commit whose message contains `ENG-201`.
4. Deliver the push webhook or wait for reconciliation.

Expected result:

- the commit links directly to `ENG-201`
- `ENG-201` shows the commit in its `Development` section
- `ENG-200` shows the commit in `Child Issue Commits`
- the parent does not get a direct commit link unless its own key is referenced

### Test 6: Suppression

1. Let an artifact auto-link to an issue.
2. In the issue `Development` section, click `Suppress`.
3. Re-deliver the webhook or wait for reconciliation.

Expected result:

- the artifact stays unlinked
- it does not come back on the next sync

### Test 7: Refresh and stale data

1. Link a PR.
2. Let the cached data become old, or just change the PR in GitHub.
3. Open the issue page.
4. Click `Refresh` if needed.

Expected result:

- stale artifacts are marked `Stale`
- opening the page triggers a refresh when the cache is old
- manual refresh updates the displayed status

## Webhook Testing

The webhook endpoint is:

```text
/webhooks/github
```

Events handled in v1:

- `pull_request`
- `issues`
- `push`
- `installation`
- `installation_repositories`

Recommended local test loop:

1. expose your local app with a tunnel
2. point the GitHub App webhook to your tunnel URL
3. use GitHub webhook delivery logs to redeliver events after code changes

If webhook delivery is failing:

- verify the webhook secret in the GitHub App matches the secret currently generated in Vector
- verify the webhook points to the correct environment
- verify the repo is selected in Vector
- verify the GitHub App or token has access to that repo

## Reconcile Testing

The reconcile job runs every 10 minutes.

Use it to test:

- missed webhook recovery
- newly discoverable links in recent PRs/issues/commits
- repo access changes

Expected behavior:

- recent artifacts from the last 14 days are refreshed
- linked artifacts are refreshed even if webhooks were missed

## Debug Checklist

### Manual link says repo is not connected

Check:

- the repo exists in org settings
- the repo is selected
- the URL matches the repo exactly

### Artifact never auto-links

Check:

- the issue key is in PR title/body/branch, commit message, or GitHub issue title/body
- the repo is selected
- the webhook event actually arrived
- the artifact is recent enough for reconcile

### Issue state does not move

Check:

- the org has `todo`, `in_progress`, `done`, and `canceled` workflow state types
- the artifact link is active
- a linked PR is not overriding the GitHub issue state

### Artifact reappears after unlink

Check:

- you used `Suppress` on an auto-linked artifact
- you did not use plain unlink on something that is still auto-matchable

### UI shows stale or old status

Check:

- the `Refresh` button on the issue page
- the org settings sync health
- webhook delivery logs

## Useful Files

When debugging, start here:

- `convex/github/actions.ts`
- `convex/github/mutations.ts`
- `convex/github/queries.ts`
- `convex/github/shared.ts`
- `src/components/issues/issue-development-section.tsx`
- `src/components/organization/github-integration-settings.tsx`

## Recommended Quick Test Order

If you only want a fast sanity pass:

1. configure GitHub in org settings
2. sync repos and select one repo
3. manually link one PR URL
4. auto-link one PR with an issue key in the title
5. close, reopen, and merge that PR
6. push one commit for a child issue
7. suppress one auto-linked artifact and confirm it stays gone
