## Stack

- Next.js 16 and React 19
- Convex for database, functions, realtime, and storage
- Better Auth with the Convex adapter
- Tailwind CSS v4, Base UI/Radix primitives, and shadcn/ui
- ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and pnpm

## CLI

Vector also ships with a dedicated CLI package for terminal workflows.

- Package README: [packages/vector-cli/README.md](packages/vector-cli/README.md)
- Local repo entrypoint: `pnpm exec tsx src/cli/index.ts --help`
- Published package target: `@rechpic/vcli`

## Project Status

Vector is under active development. The top-level docs in this repository reflect the current contributor workflow. Some files under `docs/migration/` remain as historical implementation notes from earlier architecture work and should not be treated as onboarding documentation.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js `>=20.19.0`
- `pnpm`
- A local Convex dev deployment

### Local Setup

1. Install dependencies.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Create local environment variables.

   ```bash
   cp sample.env .env.local
   ```

3. Update `.env.local` with your local values.

   Minimum app setup usually includes:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000`
   - `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<your-secret>`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-local-convex-url>`
   - `CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211`

   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` alone is not enough for local auth helpers. The Next.js server also uses `CONVEX_SITE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL`.

   If you want the assistant enabled locally, also set these in the Convex environment:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<your-openrouter-api-key>`
   - `OPENROUTER_MODEL=moonshotai/kimi-k2.5:nitro` (optional override)

   Example:

   ```bash
   pnpm convex env set OPENROUTER_API_KEY <your-openrouter-api-key>
   pnpm convex env set OPENROUTER_MODEL moonshotai/kimi-k2.5:nitro
   ```

4. Start Convex in one terminal.

   ```bash
   pnpm run convex:dev
   ```

5. Start Next.js in another terminal.

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

6. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

   On a fresh local instance, visit `/setup-admin` to create the first administrator account.

## Environment Variables

Copy `sample.env` to `.env.local` and update the values.

For local development, Next.js and Convex can both read from the same root env file, so a single `.env.local` is enough. For production, split variables by the runtime that actually reads them.

### Minimum Local Setup

If you only want the app running locally, start with these:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<your-secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-local-convex-url>
CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211
```

Optional for local development:

- SMTP variables if you want real email delivery instead of local logging
- VAPID variables if you want browser push notifications
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` if you want the Convex assistant enabled
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL` to override the default assistant model
- `CONVEX_URL` / `CONVEX_ADMIN_KEY` for migration scripts and CLI-only workflows

### Set In Next.js Environment (`.env.local`, Vercel)

| Variable                       | Why it belongs here                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`       | Read by the browser Convex providers and Next.js server code that talks to Convex. |
| `CONVEX_SITE_URL`              | Read by `src/lib/auth-server.ts` on the Next.js server for auth helper requests.   |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL`  | Fallback for `CONVEX_SITE_URL` in `src/lib/auth-server.ts`.                        |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | Read in browser push-subscription code.                                            |

### Set In Convex Environment

| Variable                      | Why it belongs here                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`          | Read in `convex/auth.ts` to sign Better Auth tokens and encrypt JWKS private keys.                                                                                |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`         | Read in `convex/auth.ts` as the Better Auth base URL.                                                                                                             |
| `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Read in `convex/auth.ts` for the auth callback allowlist.                                                                                                         |
| `SMTP_HOST`                   | SMTP server hostname for sending emails (OTP codes and notifications).                                                                                            |
| `SMTP_PORT`                   | SMTP port (default `587`, use `465` for SSL).                                                                                                                     |
| `SMTP_USER`                   | SMTP username for authentication.                                                                                                                                 |
| `SMTP_PASS`                   | SMTP password for authentication.                                                                                                                                 |

| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`           | Read in `convex/notifications/actions.ts` for push delivery.                                                                                                      |

| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`          | Required by `convex/ai/provider.ts` for the organization assistant and all agent responses.                                                                       |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL`            | Optional model override for `convex/ai/provider.ts`. Defaults to `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5:nitro`.                                                                    |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` has a public-looking prefix, but the current code reads it from Convex auth code rather than browser code.

SMTP and VAPID settings are optional. If you leave them unset locally, the core app still runs. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is only required if you want the assistant feature to work.

### Local CLI / Convex Tooling Only

| Variable            | Why it belongs here                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CONVEX_URL`        | Used by `scripts/run-permission-migrations.ts` when invoking `pnpm convex run`.                |
